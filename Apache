Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.

Maven is written in Java, and uses a declarative model to manage project builds, dependencies, and documentation. It is designed to simplify the build process for developers and to provide a uniform build system. Maven provides developers with a complete build lifecycle framework.

Maven is used to manage dependencies, build, test, and deploy Java-based projects. It provides a uniform build system that allows developers to create a new project or module using a specific set of commands. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in other languages, such as C#, Ruby, and Scala.

To use Maven, you need to have Java and Maven installed on your machine. You can then create a new Maven project by running the "mvn archetype:generate" command and following the prompts. Once you have created your project, you can build it by running the "mvn clean install" command. This will compile the code, run any tests, and package the code into a JAR or WAR file.

Maven uses a standard directory layout and a set of conventions for naming and organizing files. It also uses a central repository to store libraries and other dependencies, which simplifies the process of managing dependencies in your project.
