Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.
Maven is written in Java and uses a declarative approach, where the project structure and contents are described in a single file, pom.xml. This file contains the project's dependencies, build details, and any other information required to build the project.
Maven uses a standard directory layout and default build lifecycle, which allows developers to reuse build logic across multiple projects. It also provides a large repository of libraries and metadata that can be easily used in a project, reducing the effort required to find and include external dependencies.
Maven is often used in Java-based projects, but it can also be used with other programming languages. It is widely used in the development of open-source projects and is the default build tool in many popular Java-based frameworks, such as Hibernate and Spring.
