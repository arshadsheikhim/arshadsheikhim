Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was developed in the early 1990s as an alternative to proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. It is based on the Unix operating system and is used on a wide variety of devices, including personal computers, servers, smartphones, and embedded devices.
Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, as well as its ability to run on a wide range of hardware platforms. It is often used as a server operating system, but it is also suitable for use as a desktop operating system for personal computers.
Linux is composed of the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system, and a set of user-space tools and libraries that provide various services and functions. The kernel is responsible for managing the hardware and providing access to system resources, while the user-space tools and libraries provide a user interface and support for running applications.
Linux is distributed under a variety of open-source licenses, which allow users to freely modify and redistribute the operating system. This has led to the development of a large and active community of users and developers who contribute to the development and improvement of the operating system.
